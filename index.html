<h2>Welsh Corgi란 무엇인가?</h2>
The Welsh Corgi, sometimes known as <strong>just a <u>Corgi</u></strong>,
Welsh for "dwarf dog" plural "Corgis" or occasionally the etymologically
consistent "Corgwn", is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales,
<p style="margin-top:40px;">United Kingdom.[6] Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi.
The Pembroke is the more popular breed of the two, with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi
appearing on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. There are several physical differences
between the two types according to the breed standards: the Cardigan is larger overall,
both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used.</p>
